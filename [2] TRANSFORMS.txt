Milestone 5 Cleansing dataset using Apache Beam:

Standardization issues:-

1) In Adverse_Event table, the attributes RECOVD and BIRTH_DEFECT are of type STRING, but would be more suitable as BOOLEAN. 
In RECOVD, 'Y' needs to be converted to True, 'N' to False, and 'U' to None or Null.
In BIRTH_DEFECT, 'Y' needs to be converted to True, and None to False (as there are only two values).

2) In Adverse_Event table, there are a number of attributes of type BOOLEAN which have either True or empty/null values. The null values represent False and need to be converted as such. 
These attributes are DIED, L_THREAT, OFC_VISIT, ER_VISIT, ER_ED_VISIT, HOSPITAL, X_STAY and DISABLE.

3) In Vaccination table, for some records, the attributes V_FUNDBY, VAX_ROUTE and VAX_SITE have either empty or 'UNK' or 'UN' (Unknown) as values. To standardize them, these should be converted to 'UN'.

Normalization issues : None


Milestone 4 Modeling:

As shown in our vaers_modeled.ipynb, all modeled tables have an identified primary key, and all child tables have an identified foreign key.

Referential integrity is not violated as each foreign key in a child table is linked to a valid primary key in a parent table. 

There are no duplicate records on all modeled tables as they were eliminated through grouping during modeling.

Cast was not used during modeling as most of the attributes were assigned the correct type during staging. There are two attributes in Adverse_Event table which are currently of type string, but will be converted to booleans using Apache Beam.


Milestone 9 Modeling:

There are no referential integrity or primary key violations on the secondary dataset.
