Primary Dataset: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 2018 by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Download link: https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html

The dataset consists of 3 files - Primary Information, Symptoms and Vaccines, with around 45,000 to 50,000 rows each. 

VAERS was created to detect unusual patterns of adverse events which might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This data
contains the list of reported adverse events after a vaccine was administered as well as details regarding the patient, vaccine and 
symptoms experienced (thus, the 3 files). Among the 3 dataset files, interesting attributes include patient's age, gender, state, date 
of vaccination, symptoms (though these are all unique), if they were life-threatening, ER visit, hospitalization, death of patient (if 
occurred), whether patient recovered, current illness, and vaccine information, such as type of vaccine administered, manufacturer, 
dosage and administration route.

Our main focus is the fact that many patients died or experienced adverse effects after vaccination. We want to investigate if anything 
outside of the vaccine itself can be attributed to these deaths or symptoms. We are interested in looking at whether there is a high 
correlation between the adverse effects and particular attributes of patients or vaccines, while keeping in mind that correlation does 
not indicate causation. For instance, are patients who experience adverse symptoms from a particular state, age group, or are currently 
diagnosed with a certain type of illness? Are these events related to a particular vaccine type, manufacturer or route of 
administration?

Secondary Dataset: FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) 2018 Q4 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Download Link: https://data.nber.org/data/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-data.html

The dataset consists of 5 files - Demographics, Drugs, Reactions, Outcomes, and Indications, with around 300,000 to 1.5 million observations in each file.

This dataset (FAERS) is fairly similar to the VAERS dataset in the sense that it is a collection of adverse reactions but for drugs instead of vaccines. 
The data contains various information about the event such as dates related to the reaction and report, patient age, sex, weight, country where
event occurred, drug names, dosages, routes, drug manufacturer, medical terminology related to the reaction, and outcome of event.

We would like to focus on some of the same things as with the VAERS dataset when it comes to adverse reactions to drugs. Both datasets include an
outcome with the patient whether that be hospitilization, whether the event was life threatening, or if the patient died. We can look at both
datasets and see if there is any correlations between dates and ages and what the outcomes were. Perhaps the extremely young and old are
most susceptible to complications from drugs and vaccines. It could also be the dates that surrounding these events such as flu season.
We want to take a deeper look into what features are prevalent in these adverse events.
